<h><b>ICT- INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY</b></h>
<p><b>It deals with the use of different communication technologies such as mobile phones,
telephone, internet, etc. to locate, save, send, and edit information.</b></p>

<p><b><u>Information</u>: process data.</b>   
 <br>
 <br>
<b><u>Communication</u>: exchanging of information or news.</b>
 <br>
 <br>
<b><u>Technology</u>: application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry</b>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Internet</u>: is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses tcp/ip to link
billions of devices worldwide.</b></p>

<br>

<p><b><u>ICT in the Philippines</u>- Department of Information Communications Technology (DICT) is
responsible for formulation, recommendation and implementation of policy that will promote
development and global competitiveness of the country’s ICT.</b></p>

<h1>ICT in the Philippines – called as “ICT HUB OF ASIA”</h1>

<p><b><u>World Wide Web </u>- An information system on the Internet which allows documents to be
connected to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by
moving from one document to another.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Webpage </u>- a hypertext document connected to the World Wide Web.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Website </u>- a location connected to the Internet that maintains one or more pages on the World Wide
Web.</b></p>

<br>

<h2>Three (3) kinds of website:</h2>
<p><b><u>1. Static web – web 1.0 </u>- A static website contains Web pages with fixed content.
Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor.
Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create.</b></p>

<p><b><u>2. Dynamic web - web 2.0</u>- Dynamic websites contain Web pages that are generated in real-time. These pages include Web scripting code, such as PHP or ASP. When a dynamic page is
accessed, the code within the page is parsed on the Web server and the resulting HTML is sent to
the client's Web browser.</b></p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
 
<p><b><u>Folksonomy</u>:  it allows you to categorize and arrange information.</b></p>
<p><b><u>Rich user experience</u>:  responsive to user’s input.</b></p>
<p><b><u>User Participation:</u> owner of the website is allowed to put content.</b></p> 
<p><b><u>Long Tail</u>:  service that are offered on demand rather than on a one-time purchase.</b></p>
<p><b><u>Software or Service</u>:  subscribed to software when only needed rather than purchasing.</b></p> 
<p><b><u>Mass participation</u>:  diverse information sharing through universal web access.</b></p>
<br>

<p><b><u>3. Semantic web – web 3.0</u>- a proposed development of the World Wide Web in which
data in web pages is structured and tagged in such a way that it can be read directly
by computers.</b></p>

 <h4>Problem’s with Web 3.0</h4>
<b><p>-Compatibility <br>
-Security <br>
-Vastness <br>
-Vagueness <br>
-Logic</p></b>

<h5>Trends in ICT</h5> 
<p><u><b>Convergence </u>- the process or state of converging.</b></p>

<p><u><b>Social Media</u>- websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to
participate in social networking.</b></p>

<h6>Six types of social media: 
<br>
<br>
-Social networks <br>
-Bookmarking sites <br>
-Social News <br>
-Media Sharing <br>
-Micro blogging <br>
-Blogs and Forums</h6>

<p><b><u>Mobile Technologies</u>-technology used for cellular communication. Many experts believe
that the future of computer technology rests in mobile computing with wireless networking. Mobile
computing by way of tablet computers is becoming more popular.</b></p>

<p><b><u>Assistive Media</u>-Assistive technology is any device, software, or equipment that helps
people work around their challenges. Some examples of assistive technology are text-to-speech and
word prediction. Assistive technology includes low-tech tools, too, like pencil grips.</b></p>
